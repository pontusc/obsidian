## Ingredients

- 450g brussels sprouts
- 1 lemon
- 60ml extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- ½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes
- 500g shelf-stable or refrigerated potato gnocchi
- 85g unsalted butter, sliced into 6 pieces
- ½ teaspoon honey
- Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving

## Steps
**Step 1**
Trim and halve the brussels sprouts. Using a vegetable peeler, peel thick strips of lemon zest, then coarsely chop. (You should have about 10ml chopped zest.)

**Step 2**
In a large (preferably 30cm) skillet, heat 45ml olive oil over medium-high. Add the brussels sprouts, season with ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper, then arrange cut side down in an even layer. Scatter the lemon zest over the top and cook, undisturbed, until well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, stir and cook until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.

**Step 3**
In the same skillet, heat the remaining 15ml olive oil over medium-high. Break up any stuck gnocchi, add them to the pan and cook, covered and undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the butter and honey, season with salt and generous black pepper, and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the brussels sprouts until warmed through. Serve with grated Parmesan.
